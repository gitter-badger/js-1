You can find details for each step here. Look for the step you are having
issues on for full instructions. If you still have questions, check out the Gitter channel!

1. **Find** an unsolved problem titled "new-member-x" under [Issues](../../issues)
 or if none exist, create a new issue asking for one
  - This can have a title such as 'New member in need of a problem'
1. **Reserve** the issue by commenting that you intend to
solve the problem, or assigning it to yourself
1. **Solve** the problem locally
1. **Create a branch** with a descriptive name (e.g. new-member-x)
  - To create a branch, click on the repo name (js), then click on the
  "Branch: master" button, and type in the new branch name
1. **Push** your solution to the newly created branch.
  - See resources at the bottom of the page for more info on how to do this
1. **Create a pull request** to allow someone to merge your solution onto the repo
  - Click on the green pull request button which is next to the new branch button
  - Set the "base" to "master" and the "compare" to your new branch name
  - Someone will merge your pull request after they double check that your solution is correct
1. **Post a new *simple* JS problem** titled "new-member-x+1" under Issues for
the next person to practice.
  - Keep the problem simple! Have a look at 8kyu and 7kyu Katas on Codewars for inspiration.
