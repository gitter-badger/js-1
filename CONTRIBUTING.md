1. **Find** an unsolved problem titled "new-member-x" under [Issues](../../issues), or ask for one by creating a new issue if none exist.
1. **Reserve** the issue by commenting that you intend to solve the problem, or assigning it to yourself.
1. **Solve** the problem locally.
* **Create a branch** with a descriptive name (e.g. new-member-x).
  - To create a branch, click on the repo name (js), then click on the "Branch: master" button, and type in the new branch name
1. **Push** your solution to the newly created branch.
  - See resources at the bottom of the page for more info on how to do this.
1. **Create a pull request** to allow someone to merge your solution onto the repo.
  - Click on the green pull request button which is next to the new branch button.
  - Set the "base" to "master" and the "compare" to your new branch name.
  - Someone will merge your pull request after they double check that your solution is correct.
1. **Post a new simple JS problem** titled "new-member-x+1" under Issues for the next person to practice. Keep the problem simple!
