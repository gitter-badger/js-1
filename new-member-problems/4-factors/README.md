# Finding factors of a positive number

Create a function that takes a number and finds the factors of it, listing them in **descending** order.

If the parameter is not an integer or is a negative integer, return `-1`

The returned factors should be in an array

**Example:**

`factors(54)` should return `[54, 27, 18, 9, 6, 3, 2, 1]`
