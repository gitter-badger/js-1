Write a function to work out who is owed what when a group of friends all pay different amounts toward a bill.

* The function should take one parameter: an object with two or more name-value pairs which represent the members of the group and the amount spent by each.
* The function should return an object with the same names, showing how much money the members should pay or receive.

**Further points:**

 * The values should be positive numbers if the person should receive money from the group, negative numbers if they owe money to the group.
 * If value is a decimal, round to two decimal places.

Example

3 friends go out together: A pays £20, B pays £15, and C pays £10 toward the bill. The function should return an object showing that A should receive £5, B should receive £0, and C should pay £5.
