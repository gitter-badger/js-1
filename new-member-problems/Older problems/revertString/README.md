# Revert String

I suggest improving upon the provious version of revertString function.

##  Input
String of any length, *only alphabetical characters and spaces*

## Output
String of reverted input, preserving the original order of capital letters and order of words.
**Example:**
Input: "Hello WorLD"
Output: "Olleh DlrOW"

## What to do
Please modify the existing code so that it handles input like specified above and submit a pull request when ready.
