create a function findSum() which can be used in the following way:
var plus2 = findSum(2);
plus2(5); => 7
OR
findSum(4)(6); => 10

For those not sure where to start or not being sure why the solution works, read [this](http://eloquentjavascript.net/05_higher_order.html) chapter of Eloquent Javascript, especially section "Higher-order functions".
