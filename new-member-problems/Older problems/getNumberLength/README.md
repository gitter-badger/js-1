There is a term exponential (scientific) notation used with very large or small numbers. It uses positive and negative exponents to write multiples and submultiples of 10 and simplifies numbers by getting rid of zeros.
So if your number greater than 21 digits it is displayed in exponential notation and if you try to get the length of it by converting to the string you would get wrong number of length because of the specific way of its display.

You should write a function in getNumberLength.js file which helps you to correctly define the length of given number. Function takes any number with number of digits greater than 21 and returns the length in number. If the input is string or number with number of digits equal or less than 21 it returns string "wrong input". 

For example:
If input number is 9000000000000000000000, then it should return its length in number, in this case 22.
If number is 222222222 or "5263","asdf///" then it should return string 'wrong input'.
